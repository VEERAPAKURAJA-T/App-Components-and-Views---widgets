 Explanation:
 Activities:  
    Activities represent the screens or UI elements in an Android app. Each activity typically corresponds to a single user interface screen and handles user interactions. 

    Fragments:  
    Fragments are modular sections of an activity that can be combined to create a multi-pane UI or reusable components. They enable flexible and responsive UI design, especially for larger screens or tablets. Services:  Services are background processes that run independently of the UI and perform tasks such as handling network requests, playing music, or updating data.
